### This Is Not an Options Pricing Model 

I'm not too certain that the original publication of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model">The Black-Scholes Model</a> expected to see it used on the valuation of a Code Review.  Thankfully, we don't have immediate plans to use it to set code-review prices.  However, being that Antipattern.io, in the most simplistic 'x for y' sense is really like 'uber for code reviews', we must therefore make some decisions about valuation.

That being said, there is an interesting question to explore here; 

#### 'What <i>IS</i> a code review worth?'

A code review could be simple, it could be complex.  A reviewer could spend 5 minutes or 4 hours looking at your code.  The first code review that I received through Antipattern.io, the code reviewer told me he spent upwards of three hours (this person is someone who works on very useful code like <a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/commit/c3d543aae43d4600512520a0d70723ac31f2cb62">angular ui-router</a>). 

While Antipattern.io is in the early stages, I have picked three price points for code reviews because they are three values that I can relate to.  They are values that provide a small spectrum that allow easy access to the marketplace but also provide some financial incentive to more seasoned participants.  I think that when it comes time to consider what a code review is worth there are more guidelines to think about than hard rules.

### Consider...

1. What value does code improvement bring to a developer?
1. What value does teaching bring to a developer?
1. How would one 'value' the act of teaching or learning?
1. How much is a developer's time worth?
1. How much is saving pain and frustation worth? 

More useful questions for the person receiving a code review;

1. What is the value delivered to me through the code review?
1. What is the time of the person reviewing my code worth?

The value of the code review lies somewhere between the above two questions.

If you are reading this and thinking, hmmm, these answers are terrible, you may be right.  I think that I'll be exploring this topic extensively over the next few months.  If you have insight or want to talk about, feel free to email me <a href="mailto:jd@antipattern.io">jd@antipattern.io</a> or comment in-line.
