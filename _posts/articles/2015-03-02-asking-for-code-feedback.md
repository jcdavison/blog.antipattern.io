Part of the tricky part about asking for a Code Review revolves around the fact that you want someone to help identify the problematic code you've written.  If you in all situations knew the code that was problematic there is a good chance you wouldn't be asking for a review of it, you'd just fix it naturally on your own.  This dilemna strikes on the nature of 'how does one ask for feedback on something yet unidentified?'... so on and so forth.

There is no one solutions for asking for amazing code reviews but the one characteristic that will help any code reviewer is to be precise.
  
Asking for feedback on individual commits of code where those commits represent small, logic units of code that revolve around a single feature or problem can really aid the code reviewer.  

Notice in the below code review that I'm asking for feedback on specific commits and I'm discussing potential antipatterns that I'm aware of.

Realize that the purpose of a code review is to have another developer look a the code you have written and give you perspective on the parts they think make sense or don't make sense.  A code review isn't aimed at 'fixing' all or any of your potentially broken code.  StackOverflow does an excellent job at helping people get answers to questions they are stuck on.  

The point of AntiPattern.io is to help a developer grow skills through code feedback.  Ask questions that challenge your own assumptions about the how and why of the code you have written.  Be precise, link to commits and provide as much context as you can.
