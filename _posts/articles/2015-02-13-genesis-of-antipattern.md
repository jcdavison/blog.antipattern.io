### A Virtuous Feedback Loop

I've been a paid developer for less than three years.  Along that way I've had the opportunity to get high quality code reviews and had to learn to give code reviews.  I realized that code reviews create a feedback loop that propegates and rewards things like learning, teaching, code improvement, increased earning potential and all kinds of other really useful stuff.  

My goal with AntiPattern.io is to build a community of developers who constantly teach and learn from each other.  

I'd like to build a community that is a safe, professional space where other developers might come together and get useful feedback on the code they write.

### The Back Story

During my first year as a developer, I spent the Summer of 2013 working for Threadflip.com.  While at Threadflip, I was fortunate to enjoy working on an engineering team that had built a culture where all code was reviewed by usually one member of the team but frequently more.  

As the Summer came to close, I had been getting a decent amount of interest in a side project, http://rubyonrailstutor.com.  I decided with my at the time 12 months of paid experience as a developer, that I would forgo working for a startup or team and try to make things work on my own.  I did what all developers do in this situation, I went out and found some contracts.  While working on the contracts, I realized that my code wasn't getting looked at by any senior coders and that was a major issue.

Fast forward to March of 2014, after making small but steady successes with rubyonrailstutor.com, Jesse Farmer and I built CodeUnion.io.  Jesse being a veteran coding teacher and myself, beginning to accrue some significant experience as a 'coding bootcamp developer', we focused CodeUnion not around videos or lectures or books or (fill in the blank learning resource) we focused CodeUnion around the process of students writing code and then getting feedback on that code from us.  In fact, from June 2014 to November 2014, I gave about 340 code reviews.

Without getting to heavily into the details of those code reviews, my own outlook and sense of what it meant to write clean readable code changed a lot.  I finally began the process that I think of as 'developing my ear' for code.

### The Synthesis

I recently started working again as an independent software engineer.  My problems of not having anyone looking at my code persist.  Based on the experiences I had both getting my code reviewed at Threadflip and giving code reviews at CodeUnion.io, I knew that I wanted to build a community driven marketplace where developers could get feedback on the code they write.

Antipattern.io will hopefully provide developers with a community to give and receive the gift of Code Review.
