### The Not so 'Fine Print'

By participating in the AntiPattern.io community, you the user agree to ALL (as in every) of the below stipulations.

1. You, a happy upstanding member of the community, will behave in a polite, professional manner and will communicate with all members of the community in a polite & professional manner.

1. I, John Davison, Founder of Antipattern.io will strive to ensure that all members of the Antipattern.io community are communicating an interacting in a polite and professional manner.

1. Antipattern.io is a community that values all people regardless of race, gender, gender orientation, sexual orientation, political or any kind of other orientation. Antipattern.io is intolerant of people who are not tolerant of other people and we will take action to safeguard the well-being of people who are tolerant of other people. Antipattern.io will proactively remove, ban, impede (or any other necessary action) the participation in the community of any person who demonstrates intolerant behavior.

1. Valuing code reviews is probably more art than science and Antipattern.io doesn't expect to have all the answers in all situations.  Antipattern.io firmly believes that in the case of a dispute between any community members, we will always err in favor of the code review and the sanctity of the community.

1. Respect begets respect.

1. In the event that you the user are unhappy with anything, email <a href="mailto:jd@antipattern.io">jd@antipattern.io</a> and though it is not possible to promise resolution in all cases, it can be promised that your voice will always be heard and listened to. 

1. Antipattern.io reserves the right to modify these stipulations at any time.
