### Every Code Review is an Opportunity to Teach and Learn

All participants in the AntiPattern.io community will have the opportunity to donate any portion of their earnings to the Fund a Coder program.  The Fund a Coder program is an experience that will help members of this community become professional coders by paying for both equipment and seats at popular coding bootcamps.

### Binary Tree or Giving Tree

The first person who reviewed my own code on AntiPattern.io spent more time reviewing the code than I had expected.  His feedback was very valuable.  The code review had a posted value of $50, which I said I would double to $100 no problem.  Oh by the way, he said he wasn't interested in the payment.

Though not the first time it occured to me, I imagine there are many people who will not be overly interesed in the monetary aspect of this marketplace.  However, I truly believe that a good marketplace is based on people offering resources to get the services they want, which means that I don't think that building this marketplace with an expectation of 'free' code reviews is a good idea...

### The 'CrowdSourced' Coding Bootcamp Fund

As a code review occurs between two people, the person giving can donate all or a portion of the value of the code review to the Fund of Coder program.  As that fun grows, it will be used buy laptops and seats in the nation's best coding bootcamp programs.  Any member of the community who is not already a paid professional developer can apply to this program.  Once the AntiPattern.io community is a bit bigger, I'll introduce the marketplace features required to allow members to apply and to also allow the community to vote of whomever they think should receive the 'scholarship'.

As an aside, there are many details involved in managing this program.  I've never personally managed anything like this but I have lots of financial management experience.  I'll need to figure out the details, some of which might involve forming a Corp B corp.  In time, I'll promulage more clear structure and details on how to applly to this program and how to participate in it as a general member of the AntiPattern.io community.

### My Personal Commitment

For the rest of time, I will allocate 50% of everything that I earn reviewing code in the AntiPattern.io community to the Fund a Coder Program. 

I am really excited about this.
