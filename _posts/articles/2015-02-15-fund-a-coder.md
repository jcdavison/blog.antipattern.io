### Every Code Review is an Opportunity to Teach and Learn

The Fund-A-Coder program is an experience that will help members of this community become professional coders by paying for both equipment and seats at popular coding bootcamps.

### Option #1

Code Reviewers can can contribute any portion of their earnings to the Fund-A-Coder program.

### Option #2

Code Reviewers can choose to exchange their time for Karma.  As soon as possible, I will get large tech companies to make contributions to the Fund-A-Coder program that correlate to the accumulation of Karma.

### The 'Crowd-Sourced' Coding Bootcamp Fund

As the Fund-A-Coder program grows, it will be used buy laptops and seats in the nation's best coding bootcamp programs.  Any member of the community who is not already a paid professional developer can apply to this program.

As an aside, there are many details involved in managing this program that need to be addressed.  I've never personally managed anything like this but I have lots of financial management experience.  I'll need to figure out the details, some of which might involve forming a corp 'B'.  In time, I'll promulgate a more clear structure and details on how to apply to this program and how to participate in it as a general member of the AntiPattern.io community. If you have questions, comments or concerns about this, please reach out to me <a href='mailto:jd@antipattern.io'>jd@antipattern.io</a>.

### My Personal Commitment

For the rest of time, I will allocate 50% of everything that I earn reviewing code in the AntiPattern.io community to the Fund-A-Coder Program. 

I am really excited about this.
