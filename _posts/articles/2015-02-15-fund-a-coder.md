### Every Code Review is an Opportunity to Teach and Learn

### Binary Tree or Giving Tree

The first person who reviewed my own code on AntiPattern.io spent more time reviewing the code than I had expected.  His feedback was very valuable.  The code review had a posted value of $50, which I said I would double to $100 no problem.  Oh by the way, he said he wasn't interested in the payment.

Though not the first time it occured to me, I imagine there are many people who will not be overly interesed in the monetary aspect of this marketplace.  However, I truly believe that a good marketplace is based on people offering resources to get the services they want, which means that I don't think that building this marketplace with an expectation of 'free' code reviews is a good idea...


### Option #1

Code Reviewers can can contribute any portion of their earnings to the Fund a Coder program.  The Fund a Coder program is an experience that will help members of this community become professional coders by paying for both equipment and seats at popular coding bootcamps.

### Option #2

Code Reviewers can choose to exchange their time for Karma.  As soon as possible, I will get large tech companies to make contributions to the Fund-A-Coder program that correlate to the accumulation of Karma.

### The 'CrowdSourced' Coding Bootcamp Fund

As the Fund-A-Coder program grows, it will be used buy laptops and seats in the nation's best coding bootcamp programs.  Any member of the community who is not already a paid professional developer can apply to this program.

As an aside, there are many details involved in managing this program.  I've never personally managed anything like this but I have lots of financial management experience.  I'll need to figure out the details, some of which might involve forming a corp 'B'.  In time, I'll promulgate a more clear structure and details on how to apply to this program and how to participate in it as a general member of the AntiPattern.io community. If you have questions, comments or concerns about this, please reach out to me <a href='mailto:jd@antipattern.io'>jd@antipattern.io</a>.

### My Personal Commitment

For the rest of time, I will allocate 50% of everything that I earn reviewing code in the AntiPattern.io community to the Fund a Coder Program. 

I am really excited about this.

### In Closing...

Have a wonderful day!
