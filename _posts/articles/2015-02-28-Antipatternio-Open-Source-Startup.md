I'm continually amazed by the motivation of the open source developer community.  I don't feel necessarily qualified and I definitely don't currently have the time to build meaningful open source software.  

That being said, I view myself more as a product engineer than necessarily an infrastructure engineer.

That being said, I'm well capable of open sourcing my startup's code.

<https://github.com/jcdavison/antipattern>

I'd like to make the nature of how I build a prototype available.  

I'd also like to put some of my own ideas onto paper;

1. Most web-software is reproducable given the requisite amount of time and developer hours.

1. A successful business doesn't revolve around any one product.

1. Patent's are NOT part of my vernacular.

1. Team, community and culture will take a business way farther than machine code.

1. I have benefited immensly from the open source community.

1. This product is a small token of my commitment to helping other people grow.

If you are reading this post and would like to know anything about my product strategy, coding, design or general thoughts on life, or you want to know how any particular (good or bad) parts of the code work, just ask.  <jd@antipattern.io>

If you are an engineer who is looking at my code and think something is good or bad, and you want to give me a code review, please head to <http://antipattern.io> and open a code review and email it me. <jd@antipattern.io>

Any feedback you may have for me, I'd love to hear that too. <jd@antipattern.io>
